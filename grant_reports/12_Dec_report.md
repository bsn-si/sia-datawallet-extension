In December we've made minor improvements for the Tiri vault extension workflows. Current version is 0.0.18: https://github.com/bsn-si/sia-datawallet-extension/releases.  

We have developed the Tiri vault web page: https://tirivault.io and finally passed the Chrome web store publishing process, so you can find the test dApp on our web site or by [this link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tiri-vault-dapp-sia-testn/ebnbcapipfmiialjaapihcnienkdmgge).  
Also, we've made the Tiri vault gateway stress testing to check the throughput.
