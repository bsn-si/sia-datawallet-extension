In November we've made workflow improvements for making new wallets and restoring a wallet with a seed: new user, old user with a wallet, old user with forgotten password, etc. Also, we've fixed a few major bugs (e.g. logout problems straight after opening the dapp). Current ext. version is 0.0.17: https://github.com/bsn-si/sia-datawallet-extension/releases.  

Currently we are uploading the extension to the Google Chrome Web store. After passing the review, I'll additionally post a link to the dApp in the Web store.
